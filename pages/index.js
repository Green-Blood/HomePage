                <Paragraph>
                    Hey there! I'm a freshly minted master‚Äôs graduate in Game Studies and a full-time Unity programmer, currently rocking it at Datasakura back in my homeland, Uzbekistan. üåç‚ú®

                    With nearly 7 years of Unity experience under my belt, I‚Äôm a senior developer mostly immersed in the exciting world of game development. Beautiful graphics? Yep, that‚Äôs my jam too! üé®üïπÔ∏è

                    Aside from creating games, I‚Äôm also a Unity course creator, spreading the joy of game-making far and wide. Currently, I'm channeling my passion into developing my own tower defense game. When I‚Äôm not coding or teaching, you‚Äôll find me diving into calisthenics, spiking volleyballs, or making a splash in the pool. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèêüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

                    I‚Äôm all about living a healthy lifestyle and constantly on the lookout for better ways to stay fit and happy. Let‚Äôs make awesome games and stay healthy together! üí™
